## Reference managers



- Use a reference manager to keep track of papers you have read and make notes that will help you in the future.  **Zotero** (open source) is an excellent option for keeping pdfs and notes. Zotero also keeps a local copy of papers making them faster to access and available offline. **Mendeley** is also reasonable, but is moving to an online only platform.
